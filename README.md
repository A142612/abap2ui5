## Downport of abap2UI5

* version with compatible syntax to old R/3 NetWeaver releases
* use this branch for NW 7.02 to NW 7.42 (use "main" for NW 7.50 or higher, S/4 and Cloud)
* full functionality, only demos are not included
* for problems with this version, create an [issue](https://github.com/oblomov-dev/ABAP2UI5/issues)

#### This code was automatically downported and tested with [abaplint](https://abaplint.org/). Thank you for this great tool!
